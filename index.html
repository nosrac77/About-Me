      <p id="opening-paragraph">Why hello there! <em>Would you like to play a game</em>? Haha just kidding, I know you were kinda just forced to play one anyway. I hope you enjoyed yourself, friend. Check out the answers below to learn some more stuff about me!</p>

      <h3 class="questions">Unlike Adam, no, I don't have a dog.</h3>
        <p class="answers">Instead, I actually have rats. As of May 25th, 2017, I actually have 3 rats. I know you're probably asking "Hey Carson, why don't you have more rats?". That's a valid question. I mean come on, can you ever own too many rats? I've had rats for several years now, and in my completely non-biased opinion they are the best creatures to ever house as pets. They're intelligent and very unique with personalities and quirks that vary from rat to rat. Picture a dog, but way smaller, not as loud, and not at all like a dog now that I think about it... Great pets nonetheless!</p>

      <h3 class="questions">Nikes are just the classic shoe, ya know?</h3>
          <p class="answers">Second only to Chucks or the oh-so-classic socks and sandals combo. Nikes are legit. Some (not me) would say they're <em>too</em> legit. I've also heard that a lot of their shoes are made in sweatshops too, which is actually really sad and unfortunate... maybe we should just stay positive here. Their shoes rock!</p>

      <h3 class="questions">My birthday? Why, it's in January of course!</h3>
        <p class="answers">It's that special day that comes but once a year, full of joy and Christmas cheer. My birthday, of course! It's on January 23rd to be exact, so there's no way it could be next month. Unless you're reading this in February, and if that's the case just disregard this one. My coding isn't perfect yet, alright? As a side note, having a birthday so close to Christmas but not quite close enough to recieve combined birthday/christmas gifts was amazing growing up.</p>

      <h3 class="questions">If I had to pick a favorite actor, it'd probably be Ben Foster.</h3>
        <p class="answers">Or Max Greenfield. That guy is <em>hilarious</em>. Seriously have you seen New Girl? Do yourself a favor, go watch it right now. Meryl Streep has to be an honorable mention as she is easi- wait, what am I doing? I could totally and by my own desire make an unordered list of the actors and actresses I like the most!
          <ul id="favorite_actors_list">
            <li>Ben Foster</li>
            <li>Max Greenfield</li>
            <li>Meryl Streep</li>
            <li>Daniel Day Lewis</li>
            <li>Kevin Spacey</li>
            <li>Philip Seymour Hoffman (RIP)</li>
            <li><span>Nicholas Cage</span></li>
          </ul>
        </p>

      <h3 class="questions">Say it with me now: C-A-R-S-O-N!</h3>
        <p class="answers">Like Daily, Johnny, or the city in Nevada. So my name definitely isn't Carlton. But I honestly don't think I'd mind if it was. Little known fact about my name: it was almost "Henry" (my dad's idea). But apparently my mom intervened like "no let's make it a unique name everyone will always somehow butcher for the rest of his life."</p>

      <p id="top_ten_opening_paragraph">Something I haven't mentioned quite yet is that I have a profound love for video-games. So, in honor of all the games that have been apart of my life, I've made a list of my <em>absolute top ten favorite video-games of all time</em> in a neat ordered list (which pains me greatly and upsets the gaming gods, but unordered lists weren't an option).</p>

      <br></br>

      <h2 id="top_ten_header">Carson's Top Ten Favorite Video-Games</h2>

      <ol id="top_ten_list">
        <li>The Elder Scrolls: Oblivion</li>
        <p class="top_ten_explanations">This game easily impacted me the most. So many days spent getting completely lost in the realm of Tamriel duplicating items, fighting giant spiders with swords and magic, cave-diving, and of course completing every single sidequest before beating the game. To me this game wasn't just a way to pass the time or even just have fun, it was an entire world I could immerse myself in. It was an experience. Bethesda just keeps pumping out hits!</p>
        <li>Halo 3</li>
        <p class="top_ten_explanations">Halo 3 was my SHIT MAN. This game is easily my favorite first-person-shooter and is actually the game I thought about going pro (MLG) with. My friends and I used to play this one together so it was actually kind of like a social activity for us. Dropping f-bombs, getting headshots, yelling at teens over my headset... what's not to love? I was good at this game. I mean <em>really</em> good. If you'd like to test my merit slack me and let's dance!</p>
        <li>Final Fantasy VII</li>
        <p class="top_ten_explanations">I mean come on, Cloud is the best video-game character ever made. He's iconic. The only Final Fantasy character to have ever made it into a Super Smash Bros! Fun fact, I actually named most of my video-games characters Cloud because of how much I loved this game growing up. I probably would've named all of the pets Cloud too if it weren't for my mom.</p>
        <li>Portal</li>
        <p class="top_ten_explanations">Another game I had to add in just because of how classic it is. There's really no other game like it. It's funny, great gameplay, really inventive and challenging puzzles to solve, and also kinda spooky at times too.</p>
        <li>Super Mario World</li>
        <p class="top_ten_explanations">I hope this pick is pretty self-explanatory. This is a classic video-game. Again, just stating facts here. Gimme that cape and lemme fly!</p>
        <li>Zelda: Ocarina of Time / Zelda: Majora's Mask</li>
        <p class="top_ten_explanations">Now I know for some video-game nerds this has the ability to ruffle a lot of feathers. Putting both of these Zelda games side by side may seem wild and inappropriate as Ocarina of Time is widely considered the classic Zelda game while all of it's following games are considered mere shadows of it's glory. But those masks were amazing, and the fact that link could also do insane parkour jumps was an awesome addition too.</p>
        <li>Kingdom Hearts</li>
        <p class="top_ten_explanations">This was a disney game meant for children, so naturally I fell in love with it. This one is near and dear to my heart (no pun intended).</p>
        <li>Mega-Man X4</li>
        <p class="top_ten_explanations">This was a classic for me too. Mega-Man and Zero just looked <em>so cool</em>, and the fact that they had futuristic suits of armor and space weapons was awesome too. One of the first toys I ever owned was a Mega-Man action-figure.</p>
        <li>Bioshock</li>
        <p class="top_ten_explanations">This game is overall one of the best ever made. The cinematography, the musical score, the masterfully crafted cut-scenes, the insane attention to detail, as well as phenomenal gameplay and an amazing story-line, all make this game a classic.</p>
        <li id="ten">Super Mario 64</li>
        <p class="top_ten_explanations">This one changed the game! I don't have my statistics in front of me but I'd be willing to bet this was one of the first 3D games ever created, so that's pretty neat. And I feel like the music in pretty much every Mario game is totally underrated.</p>
