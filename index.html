    <div id="questions-and-answers">

      <p id="opening-paragraph">Why hello there! <em>Would you like to play a game</em>? Haha just kidding, I know you were kinda just forced to play one anyway. I hope you enjoyed yourself, friend. Check out the answers below to learn some more stuff about me!</p>

      <h3 class="questions">Unlike Adam, no, I don't have a dog.</h3>
        <p class="answers">Instead, I actually have rats. As of May 25th, 2017, I actually have 3 rats. I know you're probably asking "Hey Carson, why don't you have more rats?". That's a valid question. I mean come on, can you ever own too many rats? I've had rats for several years now, and in my completely non-biased opinion they are the best creatures to ever house as pets. They're intelligent and very unique with personalities and quirks that vary from rat to rat. Picture a dog, but way smaller, not as loud, and not at all like a dog now that I think about it... Great pets nonetheless!</p>

      <h3 class="questions">Nikes are just the classic shoe, ya know?</h3>
          <p class="answers">Second only to Chucks or the oh-so-classic socks and sandals combo. Nikes are legit. Some (not me) would say they're <em>too</em> legit. I've also heard that a lot of their shoes are made in sweatshops too, which is actually really sad and unfortunate... maybe we should just stay positive here. Their shoes rock!</p>

      <h3 class="questions">My birthday? Why, it's in January of course!</h3>
        <p class="answers">It's that special day that comes but once a year, full of joy and Christmas cheer. My birthday, of course! It's on January 23rd to be exact, so there's no way it could be next month. Unless you're reading this in February, and if that's the case just disregard this one. My coding isn't perfect yet, alright? As a side note, having a birthday so close to Christmas but not quite close enough to recieve combined birthday/christmas gifts was amazing growing up.</p>

      <h3 class="questions">If I had to pick a favorite actor, it'd probably be Ben Foster.</h3>
        <p class="answers">Or Max Greenfield. That guy is <em>hilarious</em>. Seriously have you seen New Girl? Do yourself a favor, go watch it right now. Meryl Streep has to be an honorable mention as she is easi- wait, what am I doing? I could totally and by my own desire make an unordered list of the actors and actresses I like the most!
          <ul id="favorite_actors_list">
            <li>Ben Foster</li>
            <li>Max Greenfield</li>
            <li>Meryl Streep</li>
            <li>Daniel Day Lewis</li>
            <li>Kevin Spacey</li>
            <li>Philip Seymour Hoffman (RIP)</li>
            <li><span>Nicholas Cage</span></li>
          </ul>
        </p>

      <h3 class="questions">Say it with me now: C-A-R-S-O-N!</h3>
        <p class="answers">Like Daily, Johnny, or the city in Nevada. So my name definitely isn't Carlton. But I honestly don't think I'd mind if it was. Little known fact about my name: it was almost "Henry" (my dad's idea). But apparently my mom intervened like "no let's make it a unique name everyone will always somehow butcher for the rest of his life."</p>

      <p id="top_ten_opening_paragraph">Something I haven't mentioned quite yet is that I have a profound love for video-games. They've always had a place in my life. From my Playstation 1 days as a wee-lad playing Spiro and Crash Bandicoot, to the angst-riddled glory days getting overkills in Halo 3 on my Xbox 360 as a teenager, and even up until now as I make the painful yet irreversible transition to PC and collect as many bobbleheads in Fallout 4 as I can when I'm not either coding or working. So, in honor of all the games that have been apart of my life, I've made a list of my <em>absolute top ten favorite video-games of all time</em> in a neat ordered list (which pains me greatly and upsets the gaming gods, but unordered lists weren't an option).</p>

      <br></br>

      <h2 id="top_ten_header">Carson's Top Ten Favorite Video-Games</h2>

      <ol id="top_ten_list">
        <li>The Elder Scrolls: Oblivion</li>
        <p class="top_ten_explanations">Something about how this game impacted me the most</p>
        <li>Halo 3</li>
        <p class="top_ten_explanations">Halo 3 was my SHIT MAN.</p>
        <li>Final Fantasy VII</li>
        <p class="top_ten_explanations">I mean come on, Cloud is the best video-game character ever made. He's iconic.</p>
        <li>Portal</li>
        <p class="top_ten_explanations">This game is overall one of the best ever made.</p>
        <li>Super Mario World</li>
        <p class="top_ten_explanations">This is a classic video-game. Again, just stating facts here.</p>
        <li>Zelda: Ocarina of Time / Zelda: Majora's Mask</li>
        <p class="top_ten_explanations">Now I know for some video-game nerds this has the ability to ruffle a lot of feathers. Putting both of these Zelda games side by side may seem wild and inappropriate as Ocarina of Time is widely considered the classic Zelda game while all of it's following games are considered mere shadows of it's glory.</p>
        <li>Kingdom Hearts</li>
        <p class="top_ten_explanations">This was a disney game meant for children, so I naturally fell in love with it.</p>
        <li>Mega-Man X4</li>
        <p class="top_ten_explanations">One of the first toys I ever owned was a Mega-Man action-figure.</p>
        <li>Bioshock</li>
        <p class="top_ten_explanations">Possibly one of the best video-games ever made.</p>
        <li id="ten">Super Mario 64</li>
        <p class="top_ten_explanations">This one changed the game!</p>
